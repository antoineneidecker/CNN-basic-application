# ✌️ Convolutional Neural Networks: TensorFlow Implementation on SIGNS Dataset

This project demonstrates a full implementation of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **TensorFlow**, applied to the **SIGNS dataset** — a collection of hand gestures representing digits from 0 to 5.

## 📌 Project Summary

In this project, I built and trained a CNN from scratch using TensorFlow (without high-level libraries like Keras). The goal was to solidify my understanding of core components such as convolutional layers, pooling, flattening, and fully connected layers.

This work is part of **Course 4** in the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera by Andrew Ng (DeepLearning.AI).

## 🖼️ Dataset: SIGNS

The **SIGNS dataset** contains images of hands displaying numbers from **0 to 5** using sign language. Each image is 64x64 pixels with 3 color channels (RGB).

- **Training set:** 1080 examples  
- **Test set:** 120 examples  
- **Classes:** 6 (digits 0–5)
